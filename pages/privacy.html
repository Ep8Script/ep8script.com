Hey! I run a pretty boring site here in terms of legal things, data collection, whatever - there's not much going on!
But there's a few other things I'm fairly sure I need to mention:<p/>
<ul>
    <li>This site is totally routed through CloudFlare, which has its own privacy policy that affects this website. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Check it out here</a>. It also uses some files from CDNJS, which has the same policy.</li>
    <li>I host this website using Github Pages. Sometimes the backend is actually my home server, in which case a log of which pages get visited is kept.
    <li>The source of this website that has been modified is originally from <a href="https://gitlab.com/QuarkTheAwesome/heyquark.com">here</a>. Thanks Ash, and hopefully that doesn't affect anything for here.</li>
	<li>Please take note of the following relating to Google Adsense:

</ul><p/>
