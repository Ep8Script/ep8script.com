    "Hey! I'm Jessica, a 17 year old Australian girl and I work on things relating to the browser for the Nintendo Switch, such as web frontends and games. You can find a lot of the work I've done on the <a href="https://switchbru.com/dns">4TU DNS</a>. I love playing games on the Switch, especially Fortnite, Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 2, Mario Tennis Aces, Smash Ultimate, and more! While I use my real name often, I of course go by Ep8Script as well!"

        As my username's fairly unique, most of my accounts are easy to find, but for convenience here's some of my prescences you might be interested in:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="{{site.canon-url}}">This website</a> - I'm obviously on my own website! I'll blog occasionally and fiddle with the backend sometimes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/Ep8Script">Twitter (@Ep8Script)</a> - Feel free to follow me here! I post a lot of random stuff, just whenever I feel like it. My DMs should be open if you wanna say anything, too!.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="u-email" href="mailto:ep8script@gmail.com">Email (ep8script@gmail.com)</a> - For whatever, I check it often enough :)
            </li>
        </ul>
        Not all of my accounts are good for contacting me, though that doesn't mean they don't exist. These links are more here for looking at my content than trying to get in touch.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a rel="me" href="https://gbatemp.net/members/ep8script.429594/">GBATemp (Ep8Script)</a> - I've posted a little bit here, and probably will more often in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/Ep8Script">GitHub (Ep8Script)</a> - Code goes here. I'll put pretty much anything up, including some private stuff while I work on it :P

            <li>
                <a rel="me" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAKiLt--UAgXSC3aXaQzaAw">YouTube (Ep8Script)</a> - I post content here relating to my work and also just memes or whatever. You should sub!

                <a rel="me" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ep8Script">Reddit (Ep8Script)</a> - I mostly lurk but you can probably find some comments or post here and there.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> (Ep8Script#8819) - Verify if you see me on a server if necessary. I'll take DMs if you need to talk to me for whatever reason. Mostly active in the 4TU Discord (relating to anything people would be interested in!).
            </li>
			<li>
                <a rel="me" href="https://fortheusers.org">ForTheUsers Homepage</a> - Blogs will be decently active here at some point. Keep an eye out for future posts relating to the DNS, and my first game, UNO.
